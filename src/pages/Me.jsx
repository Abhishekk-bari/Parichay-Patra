            <p className='text-xl mb-4'>
              I'm Abhishek Bari, your friendly neighborhood frontend developer, armed with a keyboard and a passion for creating stunning web experiences. If you ever need someone to turn coffee into code, I'm your guy! ‚òïüíª
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mb-4'> {/* Split into separate paragraphs for better spacing */}
              I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Applications, where I managed to juggle my studies and still find time to dive deep into the world of web development. My journey began with HTML and CSS, but I quickly leveled up to React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt love a little flair in their code?
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mb-4'>
              During my recent internship at Heuristic Technopark, I learned that teamwork makes the dream work‚Äîespecially when it involves brainstorming over snacks! I contributed to designing a frontend that not only looks good but also feels like a breeze to navigate.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mb-4'>
              When I'm not coding, you might find me working on my latest project, like Tweet Deck‚Äîa full-stack platform where users can tweet their hearts out (and hopefully not get into Twitter wars). Or perhaps I'm fine-tuning a sleek SaaS landing page that dances with animations and embraces dark mode like it's the coolest thing since sliced bread.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mb-4'>
              I‚Äôm also no stranger to backend technologies like Node.js and GraphQL, because let‚Äôs face pt: every superhero needs a sidekick! And yes, I‚Äôve dabbled in Docker and AWS‚Äîbecause what‚Äôs life without a little cloud computing?
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl'>
              So, if you're looking for someone who can bring your ideas to life with a dash of humor and a sprinkle of creativity, look no further! Let‚Äôs connect and make some web magic happen!
            </p>
